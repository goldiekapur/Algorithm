69. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
中文English
Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

Example
Example 1:

Input：{1,2,3}
Output：[[1],[2,3]]
Explanation：
level traversal
Example 2:

Input：{1,#,2,3}
Output：[[1],[2],[3]]
Explanation：
level traversal
Challenge
Challenge 1: Using only 1 queue to implement it.

Challenge 2: Use BFS algorithm to do it.

Notice
The first data is the root node, followed by the value of the left and right son nodes, and "#" indicates that there is no child node.
The number of nodes does not exceed 20.
