558. Sliding Window Matrix Maximum

Given an array of n * m matrix, and a moving matrix window (size k * k), move the window from top left to botton right at each iteration, find the maximum sum inside the window at each moving.
Return 0 if the answer does not exist.

Example
For matrix

[
  [1, 5, 3],
  [3, 2, 1],
  [4, 1, 9],
]
The moving window size k = 2.
return 13.

At first the window is at the start of the array like this

[
  [|1, 5|, 3],
  [|3, 2|, 1],
  [4, 1, 9],
]
,get the sum 11;
then the window move one step forward.

[
  [1, |5, 3|],
  [3, |2, 1|],
  [4, 1, 9],
]
,get the sum 11;
then the window move one step forward again.

[
  [1, 5, 3],
  [|3, 2|, 1],
  [|4, 1|, 9],
]
,get the sum 10;
then the window move one step forward again.

[
  [1, 5, 3],
  [3, |2, 1|],
  [4, |1, 9|],
]
,get the sum 13;
SO finally, get the maximum from all the sum which is 13.

Challenge
O(n^2) time.
