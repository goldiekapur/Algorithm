Given n positive integers, integer k and a number target.

Find k odd numbers or k even numbers where sum is target. Calculate how many solutions there are?

Example
Example 1:

Given `[1,2,3,4], k = 2,target = 4`, return `1`
Input:
[1,2,3,4]
4
1
Output:
1

Explanation:
There are one solutions: [1,3].
Example 2:

Given `[9,1,4,4], k = 3,target = 46`, return `0`
Input:
[9,1,4,4]
3
46
Output:
0
Notice
1≤n≤20
k≤n
There may be duplicate numbers in n numbers
For the two solutions whose values correspond to the same, as long as there are different indexes, they can be regarded as two different solutions.
