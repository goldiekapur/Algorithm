859. Max Stack

Design a max stack that supports push, pop, top, peekMax and popMax.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Remove the element on top of the stack and return it.
top() -- Get the element on the top.
peekMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack.
popMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack, and remove it. If you find more than one maximum elements, only remove the top-most one.
Example
Input:
push(5)
push(1)
push(5)
top()
popMax()
top()
peekMax()
pop()
top()
Output:
5
5
1
5
1
5
Notice
-1e7 <= x <= 1e7
Number of operations won't exceed 10000.
The last four operations won't be called when stack is empty.
