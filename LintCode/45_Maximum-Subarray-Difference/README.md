45. Maximum Subarray Difference

Given an array with integers.

Find two non-overlapping subarrays A and B, which |SUM(A) - SUM(B)| is the largest.

Return the largest difference.

Example
Example 1:

Input:[1, 2, -3, 1]
Output:6
Explanation:
The subarray are [1,2] and [-3].So the answer is 6.
Example 2:

Input:[0,-1]
Output:1
Explanation:
The subarray are [0] and [-1].So the answer is 1.
Challenge
O(n) time and O(n) space.

Notice
The subarray should contain at least one number
