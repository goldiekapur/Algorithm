911. Maximum Size Subarray Sum Equals k

Given an array nums and a target value k, find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to k. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

Example
Example1

Input:  nums = [1, -1, 5, -2, 3], k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation:
because the subarray [1, -1, 5, -2] sums to 3 and is the longest.
Example2

Input: nums = [-2, -1, 2, 1], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
because the subarray [-1, 2] sums to 1 and is the longest.
Challenge
Can you do it in O(n) time?

Notice
The sum of the entire nums array is guaranteed to fit within the 32-bit signed integer range.
