1904. Put small balls

Given the number of balls in n buckets, buckets can be operated k times (one ball can be taken out of the bucket, or one ball can be added), and each bucket has a specified maximum capacity W[i]. Find the minimum square value of the maximum difference between two adjacent buckets after operation.

Example
Example 1:

Input: 
5
6
[1,2,3,4,5]
[15,15,15,15,15]
Output: 
0
Clarification
There are a total of 5 buckets, with a maximum of 6 operations. The balls in the buckets are 1,2,3,4,5, and the maximum capacity of the buckets is 15,15,15,15,15,15.
