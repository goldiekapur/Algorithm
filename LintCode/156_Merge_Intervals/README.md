156. Merge Intervals
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example
Given intervals => merged intervals:

[                     [
  (1, 3),               (1, 6),
  (2, 6),      =>       (8, 10),
  (8, 10),              (15, 18)
  (15, 18)            ]
]
Challenge
O(n log n) time and O(1) extra space.
