中文English
Follow up Zigzag Iterator: What if you are given k 1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases? The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for k > 2 cases. If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic".

Example
Example1

Input: k = 3
vecs = [
    [1,2,3],

Example2

Input: k = 3
vecs = [
    [1,1,1]
