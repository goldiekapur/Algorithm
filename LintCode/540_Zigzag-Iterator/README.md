540. Zigzag Iterator
中文English
Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.

Example
Example1

Input: v1 = [1, 2] and v2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]
Explanation: 
By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6].
Example2

Input: v1 = [1, 1, 1, 1] and v2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6]
