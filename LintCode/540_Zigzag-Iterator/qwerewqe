Hi Qian
You at 19:32, Dec 19:
My credit card (*0172) was replaced by (*2489). However, I cannot find a transaction (around $1600), which is important for me.

You at 19:33, Dec 19:
The transaction was made with card *0172, and it should be shown in transaction history of card *2489.

Sorry it's taking longer than expected to reply. A representative will respond shortly.
Amour at 19:38, Dec 19:
As I can see your card was issued on 12/16/2019.

So it takes 4 business days to update the information on your new card.

Please wait for few days.
Amour at 19:39, Dec 19:
It will be updated soon.
You at 19:39, Dec 19:
The transaction $1600 is for my ski ticket, which will be used on 12/23/2019.

You at 19:39, Dec 19:
I cannot wait. If the transaction is not successful, it is a big trouble.
Read
Amour at 19:42, Dec 19:
Transaction will go through, need not to worry.

Its just that your card number is getting updated, so that's why you are not able to see the transaction

Be rest assured!
You at 19:43, Dec 19:
Thank you. So the transaction $1600 is successful, and it is just pending now. Right?
