597. Subtree with Maximum Average
Given a binary tree, find the subtree with maximum average. Return the root of the subtree.

Example
Given a binary tree:

     1
   /   \
 -5     11
 / \   /  \
1   2 4    -2 
return the node 11.

Notice
LintCode will print the subtree which root is your return node.
It's guaranteed that there is only one subtree with maximum average.
