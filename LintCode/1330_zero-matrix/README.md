1330. zero matrix

You are given a two dimensional nonnegative MatrixMatrix with integer values.
Your task is to determine whether there is a submatrix of cc rows and dd columns,in which all elements are 0.

Example
input:[[0,0,0],[1,0,0]]
2
2
output:true
you can choose (0,1),(0,2),(1,1),(1,2) four points as submatrix

Notice
2≤n≤2000
2≤m≤2000
2≤c≤500
2≤d≤500
0≤Matrix[i][j]≤100≤i≤n−10≤j≤m−1
n is the number of matrix rows，m is the number of matrix columns
