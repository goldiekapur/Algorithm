1874. Kth Smallest Element in a Specific Array

Given an array with an unequal number of elements in each row, and the element of the same row is increasing. Find the kth smallest element in this specific array.

Example
Input:
[
[1, 5, 7, 9],
[3, 4],
[2, 7, 8]
]
k = 5
Output: 5

Notice
The number of elements per row ranges from [0, 500]
The total number of rows <=500
The values of all elements are [1, 1000000]
We guarantee that the number of elements in the array >= K
