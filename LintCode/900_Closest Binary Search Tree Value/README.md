900. Closest Binary Search Tree Value
中文English
Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Example
Example1

Input: root = {5,4,9,2,#,8,10} and target = 6.124780
Output: 5
Example2

Input: root = {3,2,4,1} and target = 4.142857
Output: 4
Notice
Given target value is a floating point.
You are guaranteed to have only one unique value in the BST that is closest to the target.
