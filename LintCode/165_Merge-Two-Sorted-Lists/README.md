165. Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge two sorted (ascending) linked lists and return it as a new sorted list. The new sorted list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the two lists and sorted in ascending order.

Example
Given 1->3->8->11->15->null, 2->null , return 1->2->3->8->11->15->null.
