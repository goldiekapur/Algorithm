1858. Set of boxes

We have a lot of boxes to transport. To save space, we put the boxes together. Give you the length and width of each box. What is the maximum number of layers?

Example
Input: boxes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:The maximum number of boxes is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).
Input: boxes = [[1,5],[6,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation:The maximum number of boxes is 2 ([1,5] => [2,6]).
Notice
The input may not be length in front, wide in back.You can see Examle 2.
You can rotate the box, but make sure that the four sides are parallel to the four sides of the original box, that is, do not place it diagonally.
This number of boxes is between [1,50000]
The thickness of the box is not negligible, so it must be strictly smaller
