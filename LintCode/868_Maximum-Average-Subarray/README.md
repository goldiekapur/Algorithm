868. Maximum Average Subarray

Given an array consisting of n integers, find the contiguous subarray of given length k that has the maximum average value. You need to output the maximum average value.

Example
Example1

Input:  nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3] and k = 4
Output: 12.75
Explanation:
Maximum average is (12-5-6+50)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75
Example2

Input:  nums = [4,2,1,3,3] and k = 2
Output: 3.00
Explanation:
Maximum average is (3+3)/2 = 6/2 = 3.00
Notice
1 <= k <= n <= 30,000.
Elements of the given array will be in the range [-10,000, 10,000].
