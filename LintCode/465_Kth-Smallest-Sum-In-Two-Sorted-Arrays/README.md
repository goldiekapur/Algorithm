465. Kth Smallest Sum In Two Sorted Arrays
Given two integer arrays sorted in ascending order and an integer k. Define sum = a + b, where a is an element from the first array and b is an element from the second one. Find the kth smallest sum out of all possible sums.

Example
Given [1, 7, 11] and [2, 4, 6].

For k = 3, return 7.

For k = 4, return 9.

For k = 8, return 15.

Challenge
Do it in either of the following time complexity:

O(k log min(n, m, k)). where n is the size of A, and m is the size of B.
O( (m + n) log maxValue). where maxValue is the max number in A and B.
