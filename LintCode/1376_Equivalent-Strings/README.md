1376. Equivalent Strings
Given you two strings with same length, return true if they are equivalent.

Two strings a and b of equal length are called equivalent in one of the two cases:

They are equal.
If we split string a into two halves of the same size a1 and a2, and string b into two halves of the same size b1 and b2, then one of the following is correct:
a1 is equivalent to b1, and a2 is equivalent to b2
a1 is equivalent to b2, and a2 is equivalent to b1
Example
Example 1:

Input: s1 = "aaba", s2 = "abaa"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s1 = "aabb", s2 = "abab"
Output: false
Notice
Each of string has the length from 1 to 20000 and consists of lowercase English letters. The strings have the same length.
