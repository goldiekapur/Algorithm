1878. Rotated Nums

X is a good number when all the number rotates 180° and still be itself.Like "1" ,"2" ,"0”,"12021","69" and "96". It must be noted that we use numbers like the nums on the traffic lights.

Give you a len n,we need to count how many good numbers of length n.

Example
Input: n = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 good nums is "0","1","2","5","8"
Input: n = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 6 good nums is "11","22","55","88","69","96"
Notice
Rotate the whole good number, not every bit.
Except 0, good numbers cannot contain leading zeros.
