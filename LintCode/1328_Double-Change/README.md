1328. Double Change

Given the number AA , BB , pp and qq .
Each operator can make AA to AA + pp or make pp to pp * qq.
Return the minimum time make BB <= AA

Example
Example 1:
Input:
A = 2
B = 10
p = 1
q = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: after three times change, p = 8, and A + p = 10, so return 4.
Example 2:
Input:
A = 2
B = 13
p = 8
q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: after one time change, p = 32, and A + p = 34, so return 2.
Notice
1≤A≤10^9
1≤B≤10^9
​1≤p≤10^9
​​2≤q≤10
