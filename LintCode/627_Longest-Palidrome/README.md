It is actually a mathematic problem. 

The solution is to traverse across all the characters and record its count. If the count is even, then all the existences of this character will be put in this palidrome. If the count is odd, then, count - 1 of this character can be put in this palidrome.

Remember, if the odd character exists, we need to add 1 to the sumLen as one full set of an odd character can be put into the middle of the palidrome.
