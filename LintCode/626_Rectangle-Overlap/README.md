626. Rectangle Overlap
Given two rectangles, find if the given two rectangles overlap or not.

Example
Given l1 = [0, 8], r1 = [8, 0], l2 = [6, 6], r2 = [10, 0], return true

Given l1 = [0, 8], r1 = [8, 0], l2 = [9, 6], r2 = [10, 0], return ``false`

Notice
l1: Top Left coordinate of first rectangle.
r1: Bottom Right coordinate of first rectangle.
l2: Top Left coordinate of second rectangle.
r2: Bottom Right coordinate of second rectangle.

l1 != r2 and l2 != r2
