582. Word Break II

Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word.

Return all such possible sentences.

Example
Example 1:

Input："lintcode"，["de","ding","co","code","lint"]
Output：["lint code", "lint co de"]
Explanation：
insert a space is "lint code"，insert two spaces is "lint co de".
Example 2:

Input："a"，[]
Output：[]
Explanation：dict is null.


解法1：DFS+Memorization
把s按pos=1,2,...,len-1切成2半，如果前半部subStr1在dict里面， 那么后半部subStr2就可以按子问题处理。
注意要Memorization，不然过不了下面的input case:
"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
["a","aa","aaa","aaaa","aaaaa","aaaaaa","aaaaaaa","aaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaa","aaaaaaaaaa"]
