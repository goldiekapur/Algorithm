266. Expect Distance

Little K is trapped in a cave (cave A).
From cave A, there is two paths, in one path, it takes xx kilometers to go back cave A; the other one takes 22 kilometers to go to cave B.
From cave B, there is two paths, in one path, it takes yy kilometers to go to cave A; the other one takes zz kilometers to go to the exit C.
Little K always forget paths he walked, everytime he is in a cave, he will choose the path in equally probability.
Please calculate the expect distance to go out of the cave.

Example
Input:
x = 1
y = 2
z = 1
Output:
9
Notice
x, y, zx,y,z are all integeral, 1 <= x, y, z <= 10^81<=x,y,z<=10
