Description
An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access and entire integer in A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is "fetch the jth bit of A[i]", which takes constant time. Write code to find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?

Example
array=[4,3,2,0,5] return 1
array=[0,1,2,3,4,7,6] return 5
array=[0,1,2,3] return 4
